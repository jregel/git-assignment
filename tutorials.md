I am Karsh Gabani.
I just finished the Git Immersion tutorial, and I thought it was a very engaging and thorough learning experience. 
The guide covers a wide range of Git principles, from installation to more complex subjects like branching, merging, 
and using distant repositories. 

Pros:

- The lesson is well-organized and covers crucial Git subjects like starting projects, staging changes, committing changes, reversing changes, and reading history.

Cons:

- To better engage students, the user interface might be more aesthetically pleasing.
- Some complex labs may benefit from more thorough descriptions to make topics clearer.
