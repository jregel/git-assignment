My name is Baljeet kaur.
According to my last name i am done github branching and my review for this tuorial are following

1.Interactive- As per my perception this tutorial seems interactive because It can lure people to join this  tutorial. As this tutorial involves different levels such as introduction sequence which give the knowledge about git commit command and the second level Ramping up, give us knowledge about the next serving of 100% git awesomeness etc. Hence, it is the constitution of numerous level which provide knowledge about different aspects. 
2.Instructions- This tutorial is easy to learn because it divided into few steps. Each step provides information about different aspects in easy ways. 
3.Visualization- As this tutorial involves numerous pictures or graphics therefore, we can say good example of visualization. 
4.Level- It includes two main levels and four sub levels. Moreover, Git hub is free source so anybody can use this tool according to requirement.
However, this tutorial is a good way to learn new things but in case of lengthy coding like in mix bag if user forget any step in this tutorial, then the users must have to review whole tutorial again.

Graphical representation of each steps makes us understand better and we can easily follow along with tutorial.
As, Kaur balijeet state before the interactive side of this website is detailed that any person who don't know anything about coding can understand easily.
Each level designed very attention to details that evry topic gets cover within it,moreover Exercise aftre each level coverd all the topic which we have studied on that module
to be conclude, The major promblem in website UI is that , if start doing exercise and want see content of that module, we have to leave whole website and start doing everything all over.

I am Hemil Patel. 
The tutorial assigned to me was to tryGit challenges(1-25). These challenges seems more interasting to me and it helped me alot.

1) Each challenge devided into two parts, first one is instructions and second is implementations. According to that I created a repository in my account and perform all the necessary actions in order to complete it. After completion, the software automatically checked for whether it is completed successfully or not.

2) In order to complete the challenges, instructions are given. It was very clear to understand how the command line arguments works in order to complete different tasks in Git and also The graphical representations were very useful.

Overall, it was a great experience to use such software to learn Git.
