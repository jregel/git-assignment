My name is Elisha Asiri and I am currently enrolled in AIDA winter 2023 
class at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. I have been learning Git from Youtube 
videos and a host of different websites. Although it has been quite 
challenging to grasp so much in so little time, slowly but surely, i am 
getting there and the more I learn, the more i realize the relevance of 
what I am learning with respect to my chosen career path. Some of the 
websites include:
1. https://git-scm.com/doc
2. https:lab.github.com/
3. https://gitimmersion.com/
