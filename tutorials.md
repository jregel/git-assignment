My name is Adrian Bahtiar, I recently completed the Git Immersion tutorial, 
And I found it to be an interactive and comprehensive learning experience. 
The tutorial covers a wide range of Git concepts, from setup to advanced topics such as branching, merging, 
and working with remote repositories. 

However, it's important to note that the tutorial uses Ruby code examples, 
while in our class we are working with Python in Jupyter notebooks.

Pros:

- The tutorial is well-structured, covering essential Git topics like creating projects, staging changes, committing changes, undoing changes, and viewing history.
- It offers a deep dive into advanced topics like branching, merging, rebasing, working with multiple repositories, and setting up remote repositories.
- Hands-on labs provide valuable practice, helping to reinforce understanding and build confidence.

Cons:

-The tutorial's use of Ruby code examples might be less relevant for our class, which focuses on Python and Jupyter notebooks.
- The user interface could be more visually appealing to engage learners better.
- A few advanced labs could use more detailed explanations to clarify concepts further.
