I am Kamalvir Kaur.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. 
It was easy to solve all the questions as instructions were clear and concise from basic to advance levels.
 I learnt all the basics of git in an easy manner but if we want to check some step it will start again from beginning.

I went through the tutorials on https://learngitbranching.js.org/. I found it very helpful as it had interactive and engaging form of 
excercises to help better understand branching in git. But, the one thing i found which was confusing is that even when I completed the task 
in a different way, I was not able to proceed to next tutorial. I had to reload the page unless I can finish the task in one specific that
is expected.
