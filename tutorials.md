I am Karan Singh Gill.I completed the "all main git" tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. 
The tutorials were quite easy to follow and were structured in a simplistic manner which made them functionally great.
I felt that there could have been more detail to the tutorials especially regarding fixing merge conflicts from the command line, resuming the merge and other detailed steps.
