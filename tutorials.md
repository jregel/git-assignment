I am Mayur Nehete.I studied all main git tutorials including branching,merging, rebasing and many more. 
Thing that did work for me was easy to understand and on-hand practise of git step by step, it helped me understand the concept clearly.\
Thing that didnt work was the sound quality for some of the videos, it was not was easy to follow sometimes.
