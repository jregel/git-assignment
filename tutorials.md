I am Neetkumar Patel.
While browsing through https://learngitbranching.js.org/, I came across some highly instructive tutorials.The interactive and captivating exercises helped me develop a more nuanced understanding of git branching. 
Nonetheless, I did find it somewhat frustrating that I was unable to move on to the next tutorial unless I completed a task in the specific manner that was expected. If I tried to complete the task in a different way, I had to reload the page to proceed.
